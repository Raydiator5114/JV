      <div class="box">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>We specialize in HV Substation Design services, offering comprehensive solutions from feasibility and concept
            design to detailed engineering and project management. Our expertise includes preparing concept designs
            such as layouts, elevations, and site plans, along with technical specifications for HV substation equipment. We
            provide extensive support throughout tender documentation preparation, tender evaluation assistance, and cost
            estimation across the asset lifecycle. Our detailed engineering design encompasses civil and structural design,
            primary and secondary electrical design, substation automation and control, and telecommunication systems.
            We also deliver ancillary system design covering safety, fire protection, security, and more. With a focus on
            safety in design and construction risk assessments, we ensure robust project management and contract
            oversight. Our capabilities extend to protection design and settings, control and automation systems including
            SCADA, PLC programming, and integration, optimizing networks, and providing ongoing system support and
            remote operations.</p>
